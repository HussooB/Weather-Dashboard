# 🌦️ Weather Dashboard  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This **Weather Dashboard** is a multi-functional weather app built with **React & Vite**. It allows users to search for weather information, get real-time updates based on their **current location**, and switch between **Celsius & Fahrenheit**.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **City Search** – Enter a city to get weather updates.  
✅ **Current Location Weather** – Automatically fetches weather using your device's location.  
✅ **Temperature Unit Toggle** – Switch between **Celsius & Fahrenheit**.  
✅ **Hourly Forecast** – View weather conditions for the next 24 hours.  
✅ **Daily Forecast** – Get a **7-day** weather prediction.  
✅ **Clean & Responsive UI** – Optimized for both desktop & mobile.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **React (useState, useEffect)** – For UI and state management.  
- **Vite** – Fast & efficient development setup.  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Fetches real-time weather data.  
- **Geolocation API** – Retrieves user’s location for weather updates.  
- **CSS (or Tailwind if used)** – For styling and responsiveness.  

## 🛠️ Challenges & Learning Experience  
Building this project was a great learning experience. Some of the key challenges I faced:  
- Understanding **React hooks (useState & useEffect)** to manage API calls dynamically.  
- Handling **asynchronous requests** efficiently.  
- Implementing **geolocation** for real-time weather updates.  
- Creating a seamless UI with **responsive design**.  

Despite the challenges, I wanted to make my project unique by adding a **detailed forecast (both daily & hourly)** and giving users multiple options for **temperature units**.
